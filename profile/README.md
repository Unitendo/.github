# Unitendo
A unity between some Nintendo related revivals.

"We all revive so why try to kill each other"

We respect any licenses of ANY project, if there is a license violation TELL US! We will address the issue as soon as we can!

## Note
Unitendo is not a **replacement** for any services, we are an inbetween, we use other services, either for help, for accounts, or just examples of what and what not to do.

## What we're working on
We currently have no publicly available projects, but we do plan to release some soon.

Possibly in Development:
- reShop
  
  A Nintendo 3DS eShop remake that attempts to recreate the original UI with many more features and advantages.

# Unitendo
A unity between all Nintendo related revivals.

"We all revive so why try to kill each other"

We respect any licenses of ANY project, if there is a license violation TELL US! We will address the issue as soon as we can!

## Note
Unitendo is not a **replacement** for any services, we are an inbetween, we use other services, either for help, for accounts, or just examples of what and what not to do.

## What we're working on
We currently have no publicly available projects, but we do plan to release some soon.

Possibly in Development:
- Reshop
  
  A collection of homebrew apps, games, videos, promotional material, and in general just a good time. (Based off Brewtendo, but not a piracy hub, and also not well, stealing code.)
